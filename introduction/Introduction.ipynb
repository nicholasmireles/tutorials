    "\n",
    "### The Hypothesis Function\n",
    "We are all familiar with the basic formula of a line:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "y = mx+b \\\\\n",
    "\\end{aligned}\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "In machine learning terms,this formula is called our _hypothesis function_. Typically, this will be written in the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "h_\\theta(x) = \\theta x \\\\\n",
    "\\end{aligned}\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, it would actually look more like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "h_\\theta(x) = \\theta_0x_0 + \\theta_1 x_1 + \\dotsb + \\theta_0 x_{12} \\\\\n",
    "\\end{aligned}\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we have 13 x's.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Cost Function\n",
    "So now that we have our function defined, how to we \"grade\" our prediction? That's where the cost function comes into play! Now, there are many cost functions out there and which one you use depends very much on the problem you are trying to solve, and the later steps in this tutorial. That discussion, however, is outside the scope of this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, the cost function that we will be using is called the Mean Squared Error. That function looks like this:\n",
    "\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "J(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{2m}\\sum_{i=0}^{m} (y_i - h_{i\\theta}(x))^2 \\\\\n",
    "\\end{aligned}\n",
    "Where $h_{i\\theta}(x)$ is what we predicted for the $i^{th}$ example and $y_i$ is the correct value. As you can see, this simply takes the average of the squared difference between the real value and the predicted value. The $\\frac{1}{2}$ part just makes the math nice when you take the first derivative of the equation (we'll talk about that later).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Gradient Descent\n",
    "Okay, so now that we have the hypothesis function, the correct values, and a way to quantify our error, what next? We need to find a way to improve our guess for $\\theta$ using our cost function. The way we are going to do that is called gradient descent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient descent will use the cost function we defined above to gradually change the value of $\\theta$ until the cost is zero, or as close to it as we can get. The formula is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "\\theta_j := \\theta_j - \\alpha\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta_j}J(\\theta)\\\\\n",
    "\\end{aligned}\n",
    "\n",
    "So, for every $\\theta$ value, subtract from it's current value the derivate of the cost function with respect to that $\\theta$. $\\alpha$ is the rate by which we change that value is called the learning rate. This typically has a low value like .01.\n",
    "\n",
    "I know the formula looks scary, but the intuition behind it is rather simple: update each $\\theta$ by the amount of change it affects in the change of the cost function (scaled by how fast we want the the whole process to go)."

You can play around and see how many epochs it takes for it to finally reach zero (or if it ever even does!), or try different loss functions, features, or even normalization methods. I hope you learned something for this tutorial, and if you have any recommendations on how to make this better or any errors you might've noticed, PLEASE reach out to me."
